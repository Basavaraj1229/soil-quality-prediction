    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        Soil is the foundation of all agricultural productivity. It plays a critical role in supporting plant growth by supplying essential nutrients, water, and a structure for roots to anchor. The quality of soil determines the success of crop yield and overall farming efficiency. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Our platform integrates soil data and analytics to help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, irrigation needs, and soil treatment. We believe that healthy soil leads to healthy crops, and ultimately, a more sustainable future.
